DYNAMIC ELEMENTS

The number of tasks in list heading will update to count the number of active tasks in each list

Text input in the add task element

List of tasks - size can change depending on number of tasks and content of each task

I'll need to make something for the user to edit a task


POTENTIAL PROBLEMS?

What if too many tasks are added? Will it scroll? Will it still look OK?

What if the user accidentally deletes a task? Do I need an undo button?
